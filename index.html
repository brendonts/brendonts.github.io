                        <p>
                            Recently I was tasked with creating an environment for security operations users to test potentially or kown malicious links, files, and other artifacts. I facillitated this by designing a small system in Azure leveraging a DevTest Labs account, an Azure Bastion Host, a Logic App, and ARM Templates. This environment allowed security users to perform their analysis quickly and have VMs re-launched automatically after bein compromised. A contained network, use of Azure features such as Bastion, Network Security groups, and basic netwoking concepts provide an environment completly seperated from our client's infrastructure. The environment is relitively low cost and can be launched via ARM template on the fly.

                            As part of a client's Security Orchestration & Automated Response iniative, I identified automation use cases with the most beneficial impact to the organization. The result was a workflow utilizing a 3rd party ATP tool's API, Azure's automation capabilities, and the O365 suite which saved the SOC an estimated 30% of time spent on email related incidents.

This among other improvements greatly increased user/customer satisfaction. This system I put in place was easily transferable to new employees as well.
